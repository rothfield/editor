# Cursor Positioning Issue

## Problem (RESOLVED)

The cursor and cells were positioned relative to different containers:

```
Canvas (position: relative)
├── Line Element (position: relative, height: 64px)
│   ├── Cell 1 (position: absolute, top: 0px)  ← relative to line element
│   ├── Cell 2 (position: absolute, top: 0px)
│   └── ...
└── Cursor (position: absolute, top: 16px)  ← relative to canvas ❌ WRONG
```

## Issue
- Cells: `top: 0px` means 0px from top of **line element**
- Cursor: `top: 16px` means 16px from top of **canvas**
- Misalignment occurred because they had different positioning contexts

## Solution Implemented: Option 1 ✅

**Moved cursor inside the line element so it shares the same positioning context as cells.**

### Changes Made (in editor.js):

1. **getCursorElement() (lines 1864-1885)**:
   - Cursor is now appended to line element `[data-line="0"]` instead of canvas
   - Added logic to move existing cursor if it's in the wrong parent
   - Includes fallback to canvas if line element not found

2. **updateCursorVisualPosition() (lines 1970-1974)**:
   - Changed `yOffset` from `lane * 16` to `0` (always 0px for main line)
   - Cursor now uses `top: 0px` (same as cells in renderer.js:180)
   - Updated comments to reflect new positioning logic

3. **renderSelectionVisual() (lines 1163-1195)**:
   - Removed lookup for non-existent lane container `[data-lane]`
   - Selection highlight now appends directly to line element
   - Uses same positioning context as cells and cursor (`top: 0px`)
   - Fixed issue where selection highlighting didn't appear

### New Structure:

```
Canvas (position: relative)
└── Line Element (position: relative, height: 64px)
    ├── Cell 1 (position: absolute, top: 0px)
    ├── Cell 2 (position: absolute, top: 0px)
    ├── ...
    └── Cursor (position: absolute, top: 0px) ✅ FIXED
```

## Result

Cursor and cells now share the same positioning context, eliminating alignment issues.
