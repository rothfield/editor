# Beat Loops Bezier Implementation - Testing Guide

## Quick Test Steps

### Visual Verification
1. Open the editor in browser: `http://localhost:5173/`
2. Create a simple notation with multiple beats:
   ```
   s r g m p
   ```
3. Look for visual beat loop indicators below the notation

### Expected Results

#### Beat Loops
- ✅ Smooth curved line below cells (bezier arc)
- ✅ Positioning: slightly below cells (not overlapping)
- ✅ Color: gray (#666)
- ✅ Thickness: thin line (1.5px)
- ✅ Shape: shallow downward arc (3-8px height)
- ✅ Appearance: subtle, unobtrusive beat grouping
- ✅ Very small spans (2-3 items): 3px height
- ✅ Larger spans (>8 items): gradual height increase to max 8px

#### Slurs
- ✅ Unchanged from before - smooth curved line above cells
- ✅ Still positioned above cells
- ✅ Same bezier curve quality

### Technical Verification

#### Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab

Look for:
- ✅ No JavaScript errors
- ✅ No console warnings about missing arc-renderer
- ✅ Smooth rendering without flickering

#### Check Network Tab
- ✅ `arc-renderer.js` loads successfully
- ✅ No failed imports
- ✅ File size reasonable (~15KB uncompressed)

#### Check Elements/Inspector
1. Open Elements tab
2. Find `.arc-overlay` SVG element
3. Expand to see `<g id="beat-loops">` group
4. Should contain `<path>` elements for beat loops
5. Each path should have `d` attribute with cubic Bézier data

Example path data:
```
M 100 80 C 175 110, 200 110, 250 80
```

### Performance Testing

#### Many Beats
1. Create a document with many lines and beats
2. Zoom in/out (should be smooth)
3. Pan/scroll (should be fluid)
4. Look at browser performance metrics (should be smooth)

#### Single Note Beats
- ✅ Single-note beats should NOT show loops (only 2+ cell beats)
- ✅ No visual artifacts

### Rendering Quality

#### Very Small Beat Spans (2-3 notes, span ≤8)
- Expected: 3px arc height (very shallow)
- Should be subtle but visible

#### Small to Medium Beat Spans (4-10 notes, span 8-40)
- Expected: gradual growth from 3px to ~6px
- Subtle visual grouping

#### Medium Beat Spans (10-50 notes, span 40-100)
- Expected: arc height gradually reaching 6-7px
- Still understated, doesn't dominate notation

#### Large Beat Spans (>50 notes, span >100)
- Expected: maximum 8px arc height (capped)
- Prevents excessive visual prominence
- Stays subtle and professional

### Regression Testing

#### Slurs
- [ ] Slurs still render with identical quality to before
- [ ] No visual changes in slur appearance
- [ ] Slur interactions unchanged

#### Octave Dots
- [ ] Octave dot indicators still appear correctly
- [ ] Position unchanged (above/below notes)
- [ ] Appearance unchanged

#### Other Elements
- [ ] Cell rendering unchanged
- [ ] Text/notes rendering unchanged
- [ ] Symbol rendering unchanged
- [ ] Accidentals rendering unchanged

## Browser Testing Checklist

### Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Renders correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance acceptable

### Firefox
- [ ] Renders correctly
- [ ] SVG rendering quality good
- [ ] No warnings

### Safari
- [ ] SVG cubic Bézier support confirmed
- [ ] Rendering quality matches other browsers

## Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Visual curves clearly distinguish beat groupings
- [ ] Curves don't obstruct notation
- [ ] Sufficient contrast with background

## Debug Commands

If issues arise, try in browser console:

```javascript
// Check if ArcRenderer is loaded
console.log(window.ArcRenderer);

// Check if overlay exists
console.log(document.querySelector('.arc-overlay'));

// Check beat loop paths
console.log(document.querySelectorAll('#beat-loops path'));

// Check slur paths
console.log(document.querySelectorAll('#slurs path'));
```

## Common Issues

### No beat loops visible
1. Check if beats are being detected (need 2+ cell beats)
2. Check console for errors
3. Verify arc-renderer.js loaded
4. Verify DisplayList has beat-loop classes
5. Beat loops are very subtle (3-8px) - they're intentionally shallow

### Beat loops barely visible
- This is expected! They're designed to be subtle
- Look carefully below cells for thin curved lines
- Compare size to slurs above - beat loops should be much smaller

### Curves look wrong
1. Check if direction is correct (should be downward below cells)
2. Verify control point calculation
3. Check cell positioning data
4. Verify beat loop height is 3-8px range (not 6-28px like slurs)

### Performance issues
1. Check number of beat loops (should be reasonable)
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Profile rendering with DevTools

### CSS conflicts
1. Check for z-index conflicts
2. Verify no CSS animations interfering
3. Check pseudo-element conflicts

## Success Criteria

✅ All tests pass when:
1. Beat loops render with smooth bezier curves
2. Beat loops positioned below cells
3. Slurs unchanged and still render correctly
4. No console errors
5. Performance remains acceptable
6. Visual appearance matches specification

## Notes for QA

- The old CSS-based beat loop rendering has been completely removed
- SVG bezier curves provide much better visual quality
- Implementation mirrors the proven slur rendering approach
- All existing functionality should remain intact (besides visual improvement)
