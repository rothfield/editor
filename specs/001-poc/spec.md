# Feature Specification: Music Notation Editor POC

**Feature Branch**: `[001-poc]`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "poc"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Music Notation Entry and Editing (Priority: P1)

As a musician, I want to enter and edit musical notation using a CharCell-based model with support for both Number and Western pitch systems, including immediate keyboard responsiveness when the editor canvas receives focus, to create simple musical scores with automatic beat detection and rendering.

**Why this priority**: This establishes the core value proposition - intuitive music notation entry and editing with proper musical semantics, pitch system flexibility, and immediate keyboard responsiveness upon focus.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering and editing notation in both pitch systems using keyboard operations, focus management, and verifying proper beat segmentation, rendering, and pitch system handling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have the Number pitch system selected (default), **When** I type "12345671", **Then** the system recognizes these as valid pitched elements and creates appropriate beats
2. **Given** I have the Western pitch system selected, **When** I type "cdefgabC", **Then** the system recognizes these as valid pitched elements and creates appropriate beats
3. **Given** I have any pitch system selected, **When** I type "C#" or "2bb", **Then** the system recognizes these as valid pitched elements with accidentals
4. **Given** the editor canvas is displayed, **When** I set focus on the canvas (click, tab, or programmatically), **Then** the cursor becomes immediately active for typing without additional interaction
5. **Given** I have set focus on the editor canvas, **When** I type characters, **Then** they appear at the cursor position immediately
6. **Given** I have typed musical notation, **When** I press backspace, **Then** the character immediately before the cursor is deleted and beats are recalculated
7. **Given** I have musical notation with a cursor positioned, **When** I hold shift and press arrow keys, **Then** I can create and extend selections character by character
8. **Given** I have a selection, **When** I press backspace, **Then** the entire selected content is deleted
9. **Given** I have typed musical notation, **When** I view the rendering, **Then** lower loops/arc are drawn automatically beneath each beat
10. **Given** I select a pitched element, **When** I apply an ornament (mordent), **Then** the ornament renders above the selected element
11. **Given** I type a barline "|", **When** the notation renders, **Then** the barline appears and beats are properly segmented
12. **Given** I switch from Number to Western pitch system, **When** I view existing notation, **Then** the system converts and displays notes in the new system correctly

### User Story 2 - Keyboard-Only Editing (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to interact with the notation using keyboard arrows to navigate and visual highlighting for selections to enable precise editing without mouse interaction.

**Why this priority**: Essential keyboard-based editing capabilities that make the editor usable for precise musical content manipulation using only the keyboard.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating through notation using keyboard input methods and verifying caret positioning and selection behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have musical notation displayed, **When** I use arrow keys (left/right), **Then** the caret moves to adjacent CharCells
2. **Given** I have a caret positioned, **When** I use arrow keys (up/down), **Then** the caret moves between lines at appropriate positions
3. **Given** I have a caret positioned, **When** I use Shift+arrow keys, **Then** the selection expands appropriately with visual highlighting
4. **Given** I have text selected via keyboard, **When** I type new characters, **Then** the selected text is replaced and highlighting updates
5. **Given** I have a caret positioned, **When** I press home/end keys, **Then** the caret moves to the beginning/end of the current line

12. **Given** I have existing talas, **When** I press alt-t and enter new digits, **Then** the previous talas are replaced with the new ones
13. **Given** I select "Set Line Label" from the menu, **When** I enter text, **Then** the label appears at the beginning of the current line
14. **Given** I select "Set Composition Title" from the menu, **When** I enter text, **Then** the title appears centered at the top of the document
15. **Given** I have a composition title set, **When** I view the document, **Then** the title is rendered above all lines and centered horizontally
16. **Given** I select "File → Set Tonic", **When** I choose a root note, **Then** the tonic is set for the entire composition
17. **Given** I select "Line → Set Tonic", **When** I choose a root note, **Then** the tonic is set for the current line only

### User Story 4 - UI Interface and Debug Information (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want a clean menu-based interface with debug information tabs to understand the current document state and monitor application behavior during development.

**Why this priority**: Essential development tools for debugging and understanding the CharCell data structure and application state.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating menus, switching tabs, and verifying that focus returns correctly to the editor after UI interactions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am using the application, **When** I interact with menu items, **Then** focus automatically returns to the editor canvas after the menu operation
2. **Given** I am viewing the interface, **When** I switch between tabs (Document, Console Errors, Console Log), **Then** focus automatically returns to the editor canvas
3. **Given** I have entered musical notation, **When** I click the "Document" tab, **Then** I see the current CharCell array structure displayed in a readable format
4. **Given** an error occurs in the application, **When** I click the "Console Errors" tab, **Then** I see error messages displayed with timestamps
