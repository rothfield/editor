# Tasks: Real-Time Staff Notation Rendering

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-real-time-staff/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This feature follows TDD (Test-Driven Development) per Principle II of the constitution. E2E tests are written and verified to FAIL before implementing each user story.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, SETUP, FOUND)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Rust/WASM: `src/` at repository root
- JavaScript: `src/js/` at repository root
- Tests: `tests/e2e/` at repository root
- HTML: `index.html` at repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and OSMD library setup

- [X] T001 [P] [SETUP] Add OSMD library script tag to `index.html` in `<head>` section: `<script src="https://unpkg.com/opensheetmusicdisplay@1.7.6/build/opensheetmusicdisplay.min.js"></script>`
- [X] T002 [P] [SETUP] Add Staff Notation tab button to `index.html` navigation with ID `tab-staff-notation` and data attribute `data-tab="staff-notation"`
- [X] T003 [P] [SETUP] Add Staff Notation tab content container to `index.html` with ID `staff-notation-container` and hidden class initially
- [X] T004 [SETUP] Verify OSMD library loads by checking `window.opensheetmusicdisplay` in browser console

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core MusicXML export infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can render staff notation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 [P] [FOUND] Create `src/renderers/musicxml/` directory structure
- [X] T006 [P] [FOUND] Port `src/renderers/musicxml/duration.rs` from archive (copy unchanged - duration calculation helpers)
- [X] T007 [P] [FOUND] Port `src/renderers/musicxml/pitch.rs` from archive (adapted for current Pitch model)
- [X] T008 [P] [FOUND] Port `src/renderers/musicxml/builder.rs` from archive (adapted for current Pitch model)
- [X] T009 [FOUND] Create `src/renderers/musicxml/mod.rs` with main export function `to_musicxml(&Document) -> String` (rewrite iteration for Cell-based model)
- [X] T010 [FOUND] Implement beat extraction algorithm `extract_implicit_beats(&[Cell]) -> Vec<Beat>` in `src/renderers/musicxml/mod.rs`
- [X] T011 [FOUND] Implement pitch adapter function `cell_to_musicxml_pitch(&Cell) -> Result<(String, i8, i8)>` for Number and Western pitch systems
- [X] T012 [FOUND] Add WASM binding `exportMusicXML(JsValue) -> Result<String, JsValue>` to `src/api.rs`
- [X] T013 [FOUND] Rebuild WASM module: run `make build-wasm` and verify no compilation errors
- [X] T014 [P] [FOUND] Create `src/js/osmd-renderer.js` with `OSMDRenderer` class constructor and initialization
- [X] T015 [FOUND] Implement `OSMDRenderer.render(musicXmlString)` method with IndexedDB caching in `src/js/osmd-renderer.js`
- [X] T016 [P] [FOUND] Implement cache helper functions `hashMusicXml()`, `getCached()`, `setCache()` in `src/js/osmd-renderer.js`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - MusicXML export and OSMD rendering infrastructure complete. User story implementation can now begin.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1) ‚Üí MUST complete first (MVP)
  - User Story 2 (P1) ‚Üí MUST complete second (builds on US1)
  - User Stories 3, 4, 5 (P2-P3) ‚Üí Can proceed in order or in parallel after US1+US2
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (adds real-time updates to basic rendering)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) only - Can start after US2 or in parallel with US4/US5
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) only - Can start after US2 or in parallel with US3/US5
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) only - Can start after US2 or in parallel with US3/US4

### Within Each User Story

1. Tests MUST be written FIRST and verified to FAIL
2. Implementation follows (tests will PASS when complete)
3. Manual testing for sanity check
4. Run test suite to verify

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T001, T002, T003 can run in parallel (different HTML sections)
- **Foundational Phase**: T005-T008 can run in parallel (different files from archive)
- **Test Writing**: All test files for a user story can be written in parallel
- **User Stories 3, 4, 5**: After US1+US2 complete, these can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- **Polish Phase**: T078-T085 can run in parallel (different files)

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch archive file ports in parallel (all different files):
Task: "Port src/renderers/musicxml/duration.rs from archive"
Task: "Port src/renderers/musicxml/pitch.rs from archive"
Task: "Port src/renderers/musicxml/builder.rs from archive"

# These depend on above, so run sequentially after:
Task: "Create src/renderers/musicxml/mod.rs with main export function"
Task: "Add WASM binding to src/api.rs"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# All test files can be written in parallel:
Task: "Create test_staff_notation_basic.py with test_empty_document_shows_whole_rest"
Task: "Add test case test_simple_melody_three_notes"
Task: "Add test case test_render_timing_under_200ms"
Task: "Add test case test_rest_rendering"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)

3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T017-T029)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently ‚Üí MVP achieved!
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T030-T042)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1+US2 together ‚Üí Core feature complete!
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T016)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Core complete!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Measures added)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Durations added)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Multi-line added)
7. Add Polish ‚Üí Full feature complete

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T016)
2. **Once Foundational is done**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 + User Story 2 (sequential, US2 depends on US1)
3. **After US1+US2 complete**:
   - Developer A: User Story 3
   - Developer B: User Story 4
   - Developer C: User Story 5
4. **All together**: Polish phase

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies ‚Üí can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD Order**: Tests MUST be written first and FAIL before implementation
- **Each user story** should be independently completable and testable
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing (confirms tests work)
- **Commit after each task** or logical group
- **Stop at any checkpoint** to validate story independently
- **MVP = User Story 1** (basic rendering) - deploy this first!
- **Core Feature = User Stories 1 & 2** (basic rendering + real-time updates)
- **Full Feature = All 5 user stories** (measures, durations, multi-line)

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 90
- **Setup Tasks**: 4 (T001-T004)
