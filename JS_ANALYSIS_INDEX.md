# JavaScript Architecture Analysis - Complete Index

## Overview

This analysis examines the 13,452 lines of JavaScript code in the Music Notation Editor to identify architectural violations where business logic has been placed in the UI layer instead of in Rust/WASM.

**Key Finding:** 40% of the JavaScript codebase contains business logic that should be in WASM, creating severe architectural debt and making the code difficult to test, maintain, and extend.

|--------|-------|-----------|
| Total JavaScript | 13,452 lines | - |
| Business Logic | 40% (5,380 lines) | ❌ CRITICAL |

## Critical Violations Summary

### Tier 1: MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY

**Cursor State Managed in JavaScript**
- Location: `editor.js:150-156, 309, 626-629`
- Issue: State created and mutated in JS, WASM should own it
- Impact: All cursor operations, selection logic, rendering

**Selection State in JavaScript**
- Location: `editor.js:~920-927`
- Issue: Complex state machine in JS
- Impact: Impossible to test, hard to debug

**State Preservation Antipattern**
- Location: `ui.js:524-533, 614-629, 766-783`
- Issue: Save/restore state around WASM calls
- Impact: Indicates WASM API incorrectly designed

**Direct Document Mutation**
- Location: `ui.js:591, 685, 878`
- Issue: UI assigning properties directly
- Impact: No validation, inconsistent with other operations

### Tier 2: HIGH PRIORITY

**Business Logic in Validation**
- Location: `editor.js:639-658`
- Issue: Cursor bounds checking in JS
- Impact: Duplicate validation, hard to maintain

**Property Setters in UI**
- Location: `ui.js` (multiple)
- Issue: UI making business decisions
- Impact: Cannot test UI independently

## Refactoring Roadmap

### Phase 1: Move Cursor/Selection State (1 week)
```
Impact:   Unblocks all other refactoring
Files:    editor.js, ui.js, renderer.js, events.js
Changes:  Move cursor/selection to WASM, keep JS read-only
```

### Phase 2: Move Navigation Operations (3 days)
```
Impact:   Simplify cursor management
Files:    editor.js, events.js
Changes:  moveCursorUp/Down/Left/Right to WASM
```

### Phase 3: Move Property Setters (2 days)
```
Impact:   Reduce state mutation points
Files:    ui.js, document-manager.js
Changes:  set_title/composer/tonic/etc to WASM
```

### Phase 4: Clean Up Rendering (1 week)
```
Impact:   Pure rendering for better testing
Files:    renderer.js, events.js
Changes:  Remove state queries from rendering
```

**Total Effort:** 2-3 weeks of focused refactoring

## State of the Codebase

### Current State: FRAGILE ❌
- State scattered across multiple files
- Multiple sources of truth
- Business logic mixed with UI
- Hard to test
- Tight coupling between JS and WASM

### After Phase 1: MORE STABLE ✅
- Centralized state in WASM
- JS is read-only for state
- Clearer API boundary
- Easier to test rendering
- Foundation for undo/redo

### After All Phases: CLEAN ✅
- WASM owns document + editing state
- JS is pure rendering layer
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable components
- Ready for multi-view editing

---

## Anti-Patterns Found

1. **State Preservation** - Save/restore state around WASM calls
2. **Direct Mutation** - UI class mutating document properties
3. **Scattered Validation** - Same logic in multiple places
4. **Loose Coupling** - No clear API boundary
5. **Fallback Logic** - Defensive coding in UI for business failures
6. **Type Preservation** - Manually saving/restoring object fields

## Code Quality Scores by File

| File | Score | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| editor.js | D | 60% business logic in UI class |
| ui.js | C | 40% business logic, direct mutations |
| document-manager.js | D | State creation should be WASM |
| text-input-handler.js | D | Text processing should be WASM |
| events.js | C | Event routing + business dispatch |
| renderer.js | B | Some state queries, mostly good |
| file-ops.js | B | File I/O + document manipulation |
| main.js | A | Clean initialization |
| osmd-renderer.js | A | Pure rendering |
| lilypond-renderer.js | A | Pure rendering |

**Average: C+** (Below standards for production code)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read JS_VIOLATIONS_WITH_EXAMPLES.md** - Understand the problems with code examples
2. **Review Phase 1** in JS_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md - Plan cursor/selection refactor
3. **Identify WASM changes needed** - What Rust code needs to be written
4. **Create WASM tests** - Before moving logic to WASM
5. **Refactor editor.js** - Remove state management code
6. **Refactor ui.js** - Remove direct mutations
7. **Clean up renderer.js** - Remove state queries
8. **Update tests** - Ensure coverage of new WASM code
