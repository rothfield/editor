# Music Notation Editor POC Constitution

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Ratified**: 2025-10-11
**Last Amended**: 2025-10-11
**Purpose**: Define development environment, standards, principles, and governance for the Music Notation Editor POC project

## Core Principles

### I. Performance First
Every performance-critical operation MUST be implemented in Rust/WASM. JavaScript host application handles UI and orchestration only. All text processing, beat derivation, and layout calculations execute in WASM for optimal performance.

**Rationale**: Meeting sub-16ms response time targets requires compiled code for computational tasks. WASM provides near-native performance while maintaining web platform compatibility.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All features MUST have comprehensive end-to-end tests written and approved BEFORE implementation. Tests run in headless mode using Playwright Python bindings. No feature is considered complete without passing E2E tests.

**Rationale**: Headless E2E testing ensures CI/CD compatibility and provides confidence in user-facing functionality. Test-first development prevents regressions and validates requirements.

### III. User Experience Focus
Focus management MUST return to editor canvas immediately after any UI interaction (menu operations, tab switching). All keyboard operations MUST meet 60fps target (< 16ms latency). Cursor activation MUST be immediate upon focus.

**Rationale**: Musical notation input requires uninterrupted flow. Any delay or focus disruption breaks the user's creative process.

### IV. Clean Architecture
No embedded JavaScript or CSS in HTML files. All code MUST reside in separate, properly organized files. Rust modules organized by domain (models, parse, renderers, utils). JavaScript organized by responsibility (editor, ui, renderer, events, file-ops).

**Rationale**: External file organization enables maintainability, code reuse, and proper separation of concerns. Clear module boundaries reduce cognitive load.

### V. Developer Experience
Rich debugging information MUST be provided through dedicated console tabs (Errors, Log). Comprehensive data structure display MUST show both ephemeral (runtime state) and persistent (saveable) models. Performance metrics MUST be logged for all critical operations.

**Rationale**: Developer tools accelerate debugging and enable performance optimization. Transparency into internal state reduces troubleshooting time.

### VI. Standards Compliance
Code organization follows documented file structure exactly. JavaScript uses ES6+ modern syntax with proper error handling. Rust follows domain-driven design with clear module boundaries. UnoCSS for all styling with utility-first approach.

**Rationale**: Consistent code organization and standards reduce onboarding time and prevent architectural drift.

6. **Propagation**: Update dependent templates and documentation as needed

### Compliance Review
- **Frequency**: Quarterly reviews of constitutional compliance
- **Scope**: All code, documentation, and development practices
- **Metrics**: Adherence to principles, standards, and quality gates
- **Remediation**: Action items for non-compliance identified during reviews
- **Reporting**: Compliance status shared with all project contributors

### Principle Enforcement
- **Code Review**: All pull requests MUST validate constitutional compliance
- **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipelines enforce technical standards where possible
- **Documentation Updates**: Changes affecting constitutional requirements MUST update relevant sections
- **Training**: New contributors MUST be oriented to constitutional principles

### Conflict Resolution
When conflicts arise between principles:
1. **Performance First** and **Test-Driven** take precedence over implementation details
2. **User Experience Focus** overrides architectural preferences when user impact is significant
3. **Clean Architecture** guides implementation decisions but doesn't prevent pragmatic solutions
4. **Standards Compliance** ensures consistency but allows for justified exceptions

### Constitutional Evolution
This constitution is a living document that should evolve with the project:
- **Regular Reviews**: Assess relevance and completeness of principles
- **Community Input**: Encourage feedback and suggestions from all contributors
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear rationale for all principles and requirements
- **Accessibility**: Ensure constitution is understandable and actionable for all team members
