# Return Key Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented standard Return/Enter key functionality for the music notation editor. The feature splits the current line/stave at the cursor position, moving content after the cursor to a new line.

## What Was Added

### 1. Rust/WASM Function (`src/api.rs:1115-1191`)

**Function:** `splitLineAtPosition(doc, stave_index, char_pos)`

**Location:** `src/api.rs` line 1115

**Behavior:**
- Takes a document, stave index, and character position
- Converts the character position to a cell index
- Splits the cells array at that point
- Creates a new line inheriting musical properties
- Inserts the new line after the current stave
- Returns the updated document

**Property Inheritance:**
- **Inherited by new line:** `pitch_system`, `tonic`, `key_signature`, `tempo`, `time_signature`
- **Empty in new line:** `label`, `lyrics`, `tala` (staff-specific annotations)

**Exported as:** `splitLineAtPosition` (via `#[wasm_bindgen(js_name = ...)]`)

### 2. JavaScript Handler (`src/js/editor.js`)

#### Route Handler (Line 814-816)
Added to `handleNormalKey()` switch statement:
```javascript
case 'Enter':
  this.handleEnter();
  break;
```

#### Main Handler (Lines 1480-1554)
New method `async handleEnter()` that:
1. Checks for active selection → returns with warning (undo not yet implemented)
2. Gets current stave index and cursor position
3. Calls WASM `splitLineAtPosition()`
4. Updates document state
5. Moves cursor to new line (stave+1, column 0)
6. Derives beats for both affected lines
7. Re-renders display
8. Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User positions cursor anywhere in a line
2. User presses Return key
3. Line splits at cursor position:
   - **Old line:** Contains cells before cursor
   - **New line:** Contains cells after cursor
4. Cursor moves to position 0 of new line
5. User can immediately start typing in new line

### Example

**Before:**
```
Line 0: [1][2][3][4][5]  (cursor at position 3)
```

**After pressing Return:**
```
Line 0: [1][2][3]
Line 1: [4][5]          (cursor at position 0)
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Split at start of line** → New line gets all content, old line becomes empty
2. **Split at end of line** → Old line keeps all content, new line is empty
3. **Split in middle** → Cells properly distributed between old and new lines
4. **Selection active** → Operation blocked with warning (safe without undo)
5. **Multi-Unicode characters** → Proper character counting for position conversion
6. **No lines in document** → Early return with error logging
7. **Invalid stave index** → Validation and error message

## Testing

### Manual Test Scenarios

| Test | Setup | Action | Expected |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Start split** | Cursor at pos 0, line="123" | Press Return | Line 0 empty, Line 1="123" |
| **Mid split** | Cursor at pos 2, line="12345" | Press Return | Line 0="12", Line 1="345" |
| **End split** | Cursor at end, line="123" | Press Return | Line 0="123", Line 1 empty |
| **Property inherit** | Line has pitch_system=Western | Press Return | New line inherits pitch_system |
| **With selection** | Selection active | Press Return | Warning shown, no split |
| **Multiple splits** | Multiple lines exist | Press Return multiple times | Each creates new stave |
| **Cursor position** | Any position | Press Return | Cursor at (stave+1, col 0) |
| **Beat recalc** | Line with beats | Press Return | Beats recalculated on both lines |

### How to Test

1. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:8080 in browser

3. Enter musical content (e.g., "123456")

4. Position cursor at different locations

5. Press Return key

6. Verify:
   - Line splits correctly
   - Cursor moves to new line
   - Content distributes properly
   - Check console for [WASM] logs

## Code Quality

✓ **Error Handling:** Try-catch blocks with detailed error messages
✓ **Logging:** Comprehensive debug logs with performance timing
✓ **Selection Safety:** Blocks operation if selection active (prevents data loss without undo)
✓ **Beat Recalculation:** Derives beats for affected lines
✓ **Validation:** Checks document state and indices before operations
✓ **Type Safety:** Rust ensures memory safety, JavaScript validates inputs

## Files Modified

1. **src/api.rs**
   - Added `split_line_at_position()` function (77 lines)
   - Includes detailed documentation
   - WASM-bound for JavaScript access

2. **src/js/editor.js**
   - Added Enter case to `handleNormalKey()` (3 lines)
   - Added `handleEnter()` method (75 lines)
   - Integrated with existing cursor and rendering systems

## Build Status

✓ **WASM Build:** Successful (4.10s)
✓ **JavaScript:** No compilation errors
✓ **Dev Server:** Running on port 8080
✓ **WASM Export:** `splitLineAtPosition` available in build

## Future Enhancements

1. **Undo/Redo:** After undo is implemented, allow Return to work with active selection
2. **Delete with Return:** Combine deletion + split for powerful line manipulation
3. **Customizable Behavior:** Allow users to configure which properties are inherited
4. **Keyboard Shortcut Customization:** Allow rebinding Return to different actions

## Related Features

- **Arrow Up/Down:** Navigate between existing lines (already implemented)
- **Backspace/Delete:** Remove content (already implemented)
- **Text Selection:** Select content for bulk operations (already implemented)
- **Beat Derivation:** Automatic beat calculation (already implemented)

## Notes

- The implementation respects the cell-based document structure
- Musical properties are intelligently inherited for smooth user experience
- Selection checking prevents destructive operations without undo
- All operations maintain consistency with existing document model
- Performance is optimized through WASM-side character position conversion
