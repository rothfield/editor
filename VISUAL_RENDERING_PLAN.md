# Visual Rendering Iteration Plan

## Overview
Enhance the music notation editor's DOM renderer through iterative testing using the existing hitbox tabs and Playwright test infrastructure to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy and reliable hitbox detection.

## Current State Analysis
- ‚úÖ Music notation editor with DOM-based renderer working
- ‚úÖ Hitbox tab infrastructure exists in UI
- ‚úÖ Playwright E2E testing configured and functional
- ‚úÖ Performance tests already measure input latency and render stats
- ‚úÖ Renderer sets x, y, w, h coordinates on cells for hitbox rendering

## Completed Tasks

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Enhanced Hitbox Testing Infrastructure
1. **Created Comprehensive Visual Rendering Test Suite** (`tests/e2e/test_visual_rendering.py`)

   - Validate cell coordinates match visual positions
   - Test hitbox boundaries for single and multi-character cells (accidentals)
   - Measure hitbox detection reliability
   - Test caret positioning, selection highlighting, click accuracy, visual element layering

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Enhanced Visual Debug Mode
2. **Implemented Comprehensive Visual Debug Mode** (Updated `index.html`)
   - Added "Visual Debug & Hitbox Analysis" tab with extensive controls
   - Implemented overlay system for all visual elements:
     - Cells (green overlay with character display)
     - Hitboxes (orange overlay showing expanded hit areas)
     - Caret (blue overlay showing caret bounds)
     - Selection (indigo overlay showing selection areas)
     - Slurs (pink overlay for canvas elements)
     - Octaves (teal overlay for octave dots)
     - Beat Loops (yellow overlay for beat visualization)
   - Added interactive testing capabilities:
     - Click Inspector - click anywhere to inspect elements
     - Hover Inspector - real-time element analysis on mouse move
     - Distance Measurement - measure pixel distances between points
   - Enhanced status displays and visual analysis panel
   - Color-coded overlay buttons with visual feedback

## In Progress Tasks
