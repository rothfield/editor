- Quick location guide (file + line numbers for all components)
- 17 detailed code snippets with context

- Ready-to-copy code examples

**When to use**: For looking up specific code, finding where things are, or copying implementation examples.

## Key Findings Summary

### What's Implemented

1. **Keyboard Selection (Shift+Arrow)**: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
   - Shift+Left/Right/Up/Down extends selection
   - Shift+Home/End extends to line boundaries
   - Visual highlighting with CSS 'selected' class
   - Integration with musical commands (slur, octave)

2. **Cursor Positioning**: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
   - Character-level tracking within cells
   - Cell-level selection boundaries
   - DisplayList-based pixel positioning
   - Accurate click-to-position conversion

3. **Musical Commands**: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
   - Apply/remove slurs to selected range
   - Apply/remove octave marks to selected range
   - Replace selected text
   - Delete selected content

### What's NOT Implemented

1. **Mouse Drag Selection**: STUB ONLY
   - Handler methods exist but are not wired to mouse events
   - No mousedown/mousemove/mouseup listeners connected
   - Click currently only positions cursor, doesn't start selection
   - Drag tracking variables never initialized

2. **Multi-line Selection**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Currently only works on main line (line 0)
   - No support for selecting across multiple lines

## Core Data Structures

### Selection State
```javascript
document.state.selection = {
  start: 0,        // Cell index (inclusive)
  end: 3,          // Cell index (exclusive)
  active: boolean  // Whether selection exists
}
```

### Position Units Used
- **Cell Index**: 0-based position in cells array (used for selection boundaries)
- **Character Position**: 0-based position in character sequence (for cursor tracking)
- **Pixel Position**: X coordinate in pixels (for visual display)

### Key Classes
- `.char-cell` - All cell elements
- `.selected` - Cells within selection range
- `.beat-first/middle/last` - Beat grouping indicators
- `.slur-first/middle/last` - Slur visual indicators
- `[data-octave="1"]` - Octave marker indicators

---

## Main Entry Points

### For Keyboard Selection
1. Global keyboard listener: `EventManager.handleGlobalKeyDown()`
2. Route to editor: `editor.handleKeyboardEvent()`
3. Shift detection: `editor.handleShiftCommand()`
4. Extension methods: `editor.extendSelectionLeft/Right/Up/Down/ToStart/ToEnd()`

### For Mouse Selection (To Be Implemented)
1. Should wire `mousedown` to `editor.handleMouseDown()`
2. Should wire `document.mousemove` to `editor.handleMouseMove()`
3. Should wire `document.mouseup` to `editor.handleMouseUp()`
4. Use `calculateCellPosition()` to convert pixels to cell indices

| Component | File | Lines |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Selection core | editor.js | 1090-1342 |
| Keyboard handling | editor.js | 778-825 |
| Mouse handlers (not wired) | editor.js | 1975-2089 |
| Cell click handling | renderer.js | 564-639 |
| Global keyboard routing | events.js | 130-172 |

## To Implement Mouse Selection

1. Modify `setupEventHandlers()` in editor.js to add:
   ```javascript
   this.element.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
     if (e.target.closest('[data-cell-index]')) {
       const rect = this.element.getBoundingClientRect();
       const cellPos = this.calculateCellPosition(
         e.clientX - rect.left,
         e.clientY - rect.top
       );
       this.isDragging = true;
       this.dragStartPos = cellPos;
       this.dragEndPos = cellPos;
     }
   });
   
   document.addEventListener('mousemove', this.handleMouseMove.bind(this));
   document.addEventListener('mouseup', this.handleMouseUp.bind(this));
   ```

2. The handlers already exist and just need to be connected!

## Quick Start Guide

### To Understand Current Implementation
1. Read: SELECTION_ANALYSIS.md sections 1-7
2. Visual: SELECTION_FLOW_DIAGRAMS.md
3. Code: SELECTION_CODE_REFERENCE.md sections 1-11

### To Implement Mouse Selection
1. Study: SELECTION_ANALYSIS.md section 4 & 8
2. Review: SELECTION_CODE_REFERENCE.md sections 12-14
3. Implement: Wire up the three mouse event listeners

### To Add New Selection Features
1. Reference: SELECTION_CODE_REFERENCE.md data structures
2. Model: Look at how Shift+Arrow works (fully implemented)
3. Integrate: Use same `initializeSelection()` and `updateSelectionDisplay()` methods
